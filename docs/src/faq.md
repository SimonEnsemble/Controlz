# frequently asked questions (FAQ)

**is `Controlz.jl` well-tested?**

many tests are all [here](https://github.com/SimonEnsemble/Controlz.jl/blob/master/test/runtests.jl). run the tests by `using Controlz, Pkg; Pkg.test("Controlz")`. that said, this package is not tested enough such that it can be used to design engineering control systems. `Controlz.jl` is for educational purposes at this point.

**is `Conrolz.jl` free to use?**

yes, `Controlz.jl` is free and open. see the associated MIT license [here](https://github.com/SimonEnsemble/Controlz.jl/blob/master/LICENSE.md). the source code is on Github [here](https://github.com/SimonEnsemble/Controlz.jl).

**I'm completely new to Julia and don't know where to start.**

Julia is a free and open-source, high-performance, dynamic programming language designed especially for numerical computing. See [here](https://julialang.org/learning/) for resources on learning Julia. I recommend [Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) as an interactive development environment for Julia.

**I found a bug.**

please post an issue [here](https://github.com/SimonEnsemble/Controlz.jl/issues).

**may I contribute to the package?**

absolutely! especially for fixing bugs, making documentation clearer, providing examples, etc. as for new features, please post an issue with your plan for a pull request first.
